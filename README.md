# MPID : an open-source insulator dataset for UAV inspection of power lines

Hy, Peace be upon you,

You will find in this repo a dataset [ images + annotations (Yolov7 format)] which I hope will be useful for your work (view samples from the dataset on figure 1). Especially, if you are interested in detecting insulator of different types present on electrical towers by computer vision methods.

MPID stands for Merged public insulator dataset. 
It is an open-source public dataset of real-world multi-type insulators for high voltage power line inspection by drone.
The goal of MPID is to address the challenge faced by researchers in this field. It attempts to address the lack of diverse public data that best represents the deployment environment. MPID is built by merging diverse datasets of insulator images taken during drone inspections of transmission lines. We form a set of insulator images from different times of the day, different seasons, different weather, different lighting, different angles, different cameras, and different regions of the world. But also, from different types and conditions. We collect 3 types of insulators including glass, porcelain and composite insulators. Some of the images contain insulators that have anomalies and others do not.

You can find the broken glass insulator dataset in the release part. https://github.com/phd-benel/BGI/releases/tag/dataset All the images are under the CC by 4.0 license.

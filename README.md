# MPID : an open-source insulator dataset for UAV inspection of power lines

Hy, Peace be upon you,
You will find in this repo a dataset [ images + annotations (Yolov7 format)] which I hope will be useful for your work (view samples from the dataset on figure 1). Especially, if you are interested in detecting insulator of different types present on electrical towers by computer vision methods.
